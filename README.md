The Mews Retreat is a website for an Airbnb accommodation, showcasing the space and listing amenities in a way the owner wanted to represent the property. It's a very clean and simple design.

The CMS is built with Sanity.io, as it is really intuitive for non-technical users, and has a powerful and hugely customisable CMS that works great with static websites.

Designed with Figma.
Built with React, Next.js, Sanity.io and ChakraUI library.
Hosted on Vercel.
